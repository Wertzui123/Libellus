# Libellus ðŸ“–
Libellus (from the Latin for *"little book"*) is a simple, intuitive, yet powerful handwritten note-taking application, designed for both Desktop and Mobile.

No matter if you are a student, a teacher, a researcher, or just a curious person, Libellus is the perfect tool to take and manage all your notes. It's free and open-source and can be used on virtually any device, from your phone or tablet to your desktop computer or laptop.

I have originally written Libellus for personal purposes and use it basically every day.
