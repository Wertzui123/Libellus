# Libellus ðŸ“–
Libellus (from the Latin for *"little book"*) is a simple, intuitive, yet powerful handwritten note-taking application, designed for both Desktop and Mobile.

No matter if you are a student, a teacher, a researcher, or just a curious person, Libellus is the perfect tool to take and manage all your notes. It's free and open-source and can be used on virtually any device, from your phone or tablet to your desktop computer or laptop.

I have originally written Libellus for personal purposes and use it basically every day.

## Features
* **Simple and intuitive** interface, designed to be as easy to use as possible
* **Cross-platform** and **open-source** (GPLv3 license)
* **Reactive ink that changes color** depending on whether the app is in **light mode** or **dark mode**
* **Free** and **ad-free**
* **Builtin sheet collection** for writing on scanned documents
* **No account** or **internet connection required** to set up and use the app

## Current state
> [!WARNING]
While Libellus is already usable in principle, it is currently most likely not worth being used by anyone but me.

That is mainly because of the following deficits:
* **Performance issues/lag** (especially on mobile/lower-end devices)
* **Stability issues** (some crashes and bugs)
* **No export/import functionality** (except for the builtin sheet collection)

Please also keep in mind that Libellus is
1. **raster-based** and not vector-based
2.  **for booklets** and not for single notes

by design, which might not be what you are looking for.

Also note that the code is currently pretty ugly - I will probably rewrite it soon (when time allows me to).
